# TCP PORT SCANNER

-  This is a Python code for a simple port scanner with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It scans a range of ports on a target host and displays the open ports in a list.

- In GUI window(created), enter the target host('localhost' or IP address)in the target field

- Specify the range of ports to scan by entering the starting and ending port numbers in the 'Ports' field

- The open ports found during the scan will be displayed in the list box under the "Results" Section

- Keep in mind that scanning ports on a target without proper authorization is not recommended and may be against the policies of the network or system you are testing. Make sure you have permission to scan the target before running this code
